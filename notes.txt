Analysis of low noise percentages:
    With little noise (0.5-2.5%), two groups form: 
        NEAREST & LOD create comparatively many clusters while FARTHEST, HOD & RANDOM do not form significant clusters
    With noise at 3%, HOD switches group and starts exhibiting seemlingly more clusters. 
        On visual inspection, the overall direction appears stable

Attempts to create switching behaviour:
    Start with random initialisation, NEAREST and 0% noise
    change to 0.5% noise after 1000 steps -> change to exploration behaviour -> clusters become more spread out and larger
    change back to 0% noise after 4000 steps -> change back to a single direction -> instead clusters become smaller and denser again
    -> unsuccessful

    Start with random initialisation, FARTHEST and 0.5% noise
    change to NEAREST after 1000 steps -> change to exploration behaviour
    change back to FARTHEST after 4000 steps -> change back to a single direction, albeit with non-equidistant distribution
    -> successful

    Start with random initialisation, FARTHEST and 1% noise
    change to NEAREST after 1000 steps -> change to exploration behaviour
    change back to FARTHEST after 4000 steps -> change back to a single direction, albeit with non-equidistant distribution
    -> successful. Faster, stronger reaction to switching

    same with 1.5% but it seems too much noise. outliers happen even in ordered state. 
    Conclustion: 1% seems best. NEAREST vs. FARTHEST appears to work well. Less computational load than LOD/HOD

Move switch on individual particles as preparation for external input:
    Difficulty choosing the update method for the mode 
        -> most frequent does not allow changes
        -> second most frequent leads to constant oscillations and thus prevents a change in behaviour
        -> random chance of switching to a less frequent one leads to switches but not to a change in behaviour.
    Even when updating a group of particles at the same time, no behaviour adaptations arise

Ideas:
    - Add marker to changes in mode -> new changes could be valued more highly
    



TODO:
- add method to set numcells = domainArea / (radius**2)
- possibly parallelise for loops
- start draft for paper on overleaf
- recreate key figures in pdf or vector-based
- fix matrix representation
- at least 10 runs of each
- research literature
- 

TODO:
- try to replicate findings from other fish papers with our approach
- implement active elastic
- look for papers with similiar approach (neighbour selection, adaptive networks)
- run experiments for switching
- create figures
- check who cites Calvao & Brigatti (2014)

additional: try with borders (necessary to reproduce fish experiments)


- run k =3 for high noise for longer (10'000 or 100'000 steps (from order and from disorder))
- try local order with threshold for individual switching - > propagration possible?
- rewrite with 3 sections:
    - the modes and their effects
    - global switching
    - local switching
            -> density as additional material
- redo experiments for 5-8 particles
- isolate HOD and see if density/noise switch for HOD could lead to switching as well
- try k-switching 
- check out histeresis (for sinus-curve like switching)
- fix graphs with illustrator
- replace image captions with main point I'm trying to make with it
- focus on literature research


- graph for 10 particles at 10 time steps during runs: scatterplot of all neighbours: x - orientation difference, y - distance to the particle
    - possibly video
    - aggregate over a few timesteps for each plot (e.g. 5-10) adding all neighbours from every steps
    - focus on areas with a switch (order to disorder or vice versa)
- individuals: 
    - change direction or mode/k of a subset (1%, 10%...) of the individuals and see if the information propagates
        - pick randomly overall
        - pick within a local area
- taxonomy for neighbour selection
- look for mathematical basis for behaviours
