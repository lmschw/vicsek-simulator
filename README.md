# vicsek-simulator

Features:

- Optional display of parameters in the simulation (n, k, noise, speed, radius, particle allowed to leave)
- Option to allow/disallow leaving of particles, i.e. have particles bounce off borders or leave when their trajectory demands it
- Optional highlighting of a single random example particle and the neighbour it interacts with at the current timestep
